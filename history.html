    <p>Our Story</p>
    <p>Founding</p>
    <p>The Order of the Knights of the Constitution was founded around 2084 by a group of veteran Helldivers who settled on Angels Venture. These Helldivers came from a select few elite companies that had fought in the hardest battles of the war, and these companies had worked closely together. As such, there were many heroes and generals among their ranks by the time the 1st Galactic war came to an end. They gathered on the colony world of Angels Venture, and pledged to defend the planet and its people. Normally the formation of a secretive order of soldiers would not have been permitted by Super Earth, but with the end of the war, Super Earth had the terminids to domesticate and a galaxy to rebuild, so they had other priorities. Not to mention many influential and high ranking figures supported the Order, and stopping its formation would have caused an uproar among the SEAF.  In the years after the war, the Knights built fortresses and great halls, established hierarchies, and began raising children willing to die for Super Earth, constantly repeating their ever present motto “Libertas Mortis” meaning freedom in death. The order built defenses for the planet, and for 70 years the Order operated on Angels Venture, producing some of the finest Helldivers during peacetime the galaxy had ever seen.</p>
    <p>Time between the wars</p>
    <p>However, not all was well. It was around this time that Super Earth took another look at the Order. An order of militaristic doctrine that was not directly under their control was just as unappealing as it had been before. However, many of the founding heroes and generals that had used their influence to protect the order were no longer part of the SEAF, and their influence had faded. Not to mention that the presence of children being trained and retired veterans made the Order as much a civilian group as a military one, at least in the eyes of High Command. Because of these developments, the hammer was brought down by the Order. Leaders were arrested, arsenals were seized, and fortresses repurposed. The Order’s status as the protectors of Angels Venture and its people were revoked, and this time not even the favor of the Brasch family could save them. The planet's defenders that had protected it for decades were replaced by SEAF forces. This understandably weakened the Order, and angered many, but from the perspective of High Command it made sense. After all, Super Earth hadn’t faced any threat it couldn’t handle with ease for 70 years. What need did it have for a paramilitary group that contained ultra devoted soldiers and charismatic leaders, who would be devastating if they turned against them. These concerns were not unwarranted, as in the eyes of the Knights Super Earth had only ever tried to hinder them. As allies the Order was useless at best, but as enemies they would be terrifying. Besides, it's not as if the Order were the only ones being targeted. Most veteran organizations just like it, while admittedly on a smaller scale, had been shut down years ago.</p>    
    <p>Only because of the Order’s influence and its ability to provide excellent soldiers was it allowed to remain, and Super Earth no longer needed either its input or its soldiers. However, despite its initial hostility, the transition of power was not as drastic as it seemed it would be. All leaders arrested were charged with class d crimes and pardoned on account of their heroic deeds in service of freedom. Many arsenals seized contained weapons left over from the first galactic war and were very outdated, usually only used for training. The majority of the Order’s private forts and compounds were not touched, and many of the defenses the SEAF took control of ended up being manned by troops trained by the Order. This led many people to wonder why High Command had even bothered to interfere. However, multiple significant changes occurred because of this. First, the reason for the arrest of the Orders leaders was to have an excuse to interrogate them. Not only did investigators find no trace of treason, they determined that in their old age the leaders were incapable of leading a proper rebellion. However, these leaders were forced to retire just to be sure. Secondly, among the stores of old weapons seized was a significant amount of the Order’s Exosuits. These were the backbone of the Order’s forces and only a few remained untouched. Not only that, but the Order lacked the infrastructure to make more. This eliminated a major threat. During the investigation two other things were also discovered. Firstly, the 10th Fleet, also known as “Liberty’s Vanguard”  the Fleet attached to the Order, which was once considered to be a model battlegroup, was horribly outdated, undermanned, and poorly maintained. Second, contrary to what High Command believed.</p>
    <p>Not every soldier trained since childhood became a knight and joined the division. Only the best became Knights, the rest were sent to the planetary defense corp. Not to mention that the previously believed to be illegal way of conscripting children was found to be an acceptable voluntary practice. And while this investigation technically came with an mandate to disband the Order’s army, this was easily bypassed by transferring most of the knights to civilian leadership positions, hiring a large amount of guards from the army’s ranks, and sending all other units to the newly formed planetary defense helldiver corp,  which was run and filled with troops trained by the Order, essentially providing an extra form of training before the best were recruited to be “guards” by the Order. In the end it seemed everybody got what they wanted. Super Earth no longer felt threatened by the Order, and had ensured it would never be able to take over the planet, and had let everybody know who was in charge. The knights got to keep most of their manpower, bastions, and influence, as everywhere knight trainees were being redirected were run either by retired knights teaching in the SEAF academy or to the training camps the Order sent all its trainees who didn't actually become knights. In the end, everybody got what they wanted, the Democracy officers and their Truth enforcers left, and for 30 years the Knights protected the planet </p>
    <p>The Second Galactic War</p>
    <p>The Second Galactic War was declared in 2184, it did not take the Order by surprise. The war that was being fought against the bugs had begun almost 5 years before the declaration. Angels Venture served as a site for evacuated citizens who had to leave their homes on the outer worlds. There had also been an influx of SEAF trainees to the Academy to learn near the front lines. Venture’s military facilities were working at full capacity, and enough people had been displaced that an entire militia group, made up of former charger farmers, formed under the name “the ranchers”. While it was rare for the Knights to be called upon to defend their home in times of peace, the time of peace was over. The Knights of the Constitution, the Ranchers, the SEAF army, and the planetary defense Helldiver corp were called upon constantly. Multiple invasions of Angels Venture by the bugs had been pushed back. Angels Venture began assisting in the destruction of Merida. Then, it was Liberty Day, and it was a day of light in a long war against darkness. During these many invasions, the forces protecting Angels Venture have been severely weakened. The SEAF army had pretty much been destroyed or depleted as many of its troops died in the invasions, and many of the rest were moved to reinforce different garrisions. The planetary defense corp hasn't  received reinforcements in months, and the Ranchers were all but wiped out in the first invasion, and those that were left protected civilians while they evacuated..</p>
    <p>The Knights themselves had served with distinction, but without the exosuits with which the current generation of Knights had be trained, the tactics that had been developed during the first galactic war had to be changed. Because of the war, all the recruits that would have been a pool for the Knights to draw from were either drafted into the SEAF or the Helldiver Corp. Because of this, the Order of the Knights of the Constitution was dissolved on December 25, 2184. The Helldiver Corp that was stationed on the planet was renamed to the Knights of the Constitution, the Order’s former leaders took up command of the corp, and all Knights became officers in the corp. This gave the Helldiver Corp access to the Order’s manpower, and gave the Order access to the Exosuits it so sorely needed. For all intents and purposes the Order had taken over the Helldiver Corp, except that now they were officially part of the SEAF chain of command, and were now subject to it. It also meant they could no longer choose when and where to fight. This renewed the Knights abilities to defend Angels Venture</p>
    <p>The Destruction of Angel’s Venture</p>
    <p>Before we tell of the destruction of Angel’s Venture, we need to first tell of the actions of the 10th Fleet. Liberty’s Vanguard was the fleet attached to the company, and it was often the only naval support it got. The Armada was mainly made up of Super Destroyers and Liberty Class cruisers. However, the jewels of the fleet were two Glory-Class Battlecruisers, The SES Tryanny’s Bane and the SES Honorbound. Commanded by Skull Admiral Waller, the strike force spent the majority of its time fighting in Automation sectors, as they really were not needed, with the exception of when they were deployed to defend their home during the invasions of Angel’s Venture. Around the time when the FTL jump points began to disappear, Strike force Apex, the most successful strike force in the 10th fleet, with the SES Tyranny's Bane attached, was at Angels Venture repairing after fighting off another invasion. When Dark Matter Began accumulating and was detected by Super Earth, there was concern about the matter, however, no action was taken as what the dark matter would do was not initially known. However, once it was realized that Merdia was on a crash course for Angel’s Venture, all hell broke loose. All Knights of the Constitution were recalled to the planet to assist in evacuations.</p>
    <p>The 10th fleet was also recalled. After years of saving people all across the galaxy, the Knights of the Constitution were now to save their own.. They  were given the impossible task of saving in a week that which had been build over 100 years. Besides, how could they save 500 million people and continue to fight. Almost everything from training facilities to armories to orbital fleet docks were on Venture. The Knights of the Constitution were ordered by High Command to save as much as they could. First, all relics of the Order were shipped to the SES Honorbound. Next, all Knights, recruits, and SEAF personnel were evacuated. All important war materials were shipped to the Honorbound, and an entire 100 year old stone hall was removed from an old fort, flown to space, and installed on the Tyranny’s Bane. After all essential personnel and equipment were moved to the fleet, the Knights evacuated over 11 million civilians from the planet. Then, on the 11th of February, 2185, with the 10th fleet watching. The Meridian Singularity destroyed our home</p>
